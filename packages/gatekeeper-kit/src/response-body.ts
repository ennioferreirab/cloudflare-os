 * instead of the size problem it is. The body is cancelled on refusal so the transfer stops rather
 * than running to completion unread.
 *
 * A provider that advertises the overage in `Content-Length` is refused before a byte is read; one
 * that lies, omits it, or streams `chunked` is caught by the running total. Both paths are needed:
 * the header is untrusted, and waiting for the stream wastes the transfer when it was honest.
