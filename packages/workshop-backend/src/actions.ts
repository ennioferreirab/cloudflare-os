// Action-sync core: reconciles this workspace's pending action records with a gatekeeper through
// one batch `applyActionsThrough(actionId, vetoes)` call per pass. A pass computes the decision
// frontier (manual approvals staged by the caller, then auto-approval rules, then deliverable
// vetoes), makes the call, and translates the result back onto the records: everything at or below
// the applied frontier becomes "approved" with the right attribution, a `stopped` action keeps its
// pending state plus a display-safe `failure`, and veto-cascade invalidations become "rejected"
// with `cascadedFrom` attribution.
//
// A per-gatekeeper single-flight guard (the DO's input gate is open across the RPC await)
// coalesces concurrent requests into the next pass, so two approvals arriving together produce one
// call at the higher frontier. The gatekeeper accessor is injected, keeping the driver
// constructible over a mock storage in tests.
